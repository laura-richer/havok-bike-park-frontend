Charming to the last. You don\'t know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! Jabba\'s through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser. Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice? You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. Over my dead body. That\'s the idea. I\'ve been looking forward to killing you for a long time. Yes, I\'ll bet you have. Sorry about the mess.'
